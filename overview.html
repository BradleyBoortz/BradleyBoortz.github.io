   <h2>A Brief Overview of Firewalls</h2>
<p>
    A firewall is a security system used in networking that is used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent from foreign attacks and
    harmful packets. Firewalls have proven an essential tool in network security to prevent cyber-attacks before they jeopardize sensitive information and
    cause significant system damage. Firewall are often the first line of defense for a host from dangerous connections, but it should not be a network's only
    defense. [1] Firewalls are defined by the following criteria&#58; &rdquo;The firewall is at the boundary between the two networks; All traffic between the two
    networks must pass through the firewall; The firewall has a mechanism to allow some traffic to pass while blocking other traffic. The rules describing what
    traffic is allowed enforce the firewall's policy &ldquo;. [1,2,3,4,8]
</p>
<p>
    Firewalls often get confused for antivirus software, also known as antimalware software, but there is a distinct difference. Firewalls monitor connections
    to determine the reputation of the sender, the amount of traffic between the host and the sender, and other red flags to determine if there might be
    harmful information being transferred in the connection and will stop the connection or reject a specific package if it represents a serious threat to the
    system's security. However, Antivirus software monitors programs running on the system already and compares them against a list of known viruses and Trojan
    horses, and removes the ones that are detected. Antivirus software can't stop attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which a firewall
    that can detect connections coming from the DDoS attacks can. Firewalls still struggle with DDoS though, since connections that need to be open to the
    public, such as a commercial website, often have high traffic from many sources, which is how a DDoS attack disguises itself as. [1,2,3,4,8]
</p>
<p>
    Firewalls come in a variety of types and designs, utilizing different technologies to provide adequate protection for a network. For example, firewalls
    range in complexity from packet filters to stateful firewalls, also known as circuit-level gateways, to application layer firewalls. They may also use
    different technologies, such as Structured Firewall Query Language, Linux's Netfilter, proxies, or Network address translation. All the variations of
    firewall methodologies can be utilized together form more secure networks. [8]
