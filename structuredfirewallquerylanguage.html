   <h2>Structured Firewall Query Language</h2>
<p>
    Structured Firewall Query Language is a proposed solution to the problem of network administrators managing a large number of firewall policies. Firewall
    policies take the form of (predicate) -&gt; (decision), where (predicate) is a Boolean expression that takes fields of a packet as parameters and the
    result of the decision is to accept or reject a packet. To manage a large pool of firewall policies, Liu and Gouda propose using an SQL-like database and
    query language to store, change, and extract a firewall's policy. It is different from a relational database because instead of fields in a tuple being
    values the will consist of ranges. The average query would take the format of: "SELECT Fi FROM f WHERE (F1 IN S1) ^ ... ^(Fd IN Sd) ^ (decision =
    &lt;dec&gt;)" where Fi is one field, f is a firewall, and &lt;dec&gt; is accept or discard.[4,10]
</p>
<p>
    Preliminary testing has indicated that a query on an acyclic directed graph representing the policies of a firewall takes 10ms. The graphs are called FDDs
    for Firewall Decision Diagrams, and they represent the hierarchy of policies that a packet must pass to be accepted. The language has plans to support
    union, intersect, and minus operations on returned results.[4,10]
</p>
<p>
    Structured Firewall Query Language would be a tool that system administrators could us to manage firewall policies in an efficient fashion. This tool could
    be used to improve the speed at which errors in firewall policies can be found and changes.[4,10]
