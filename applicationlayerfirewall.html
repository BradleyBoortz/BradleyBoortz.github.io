   <h2>Application Layer Firewalls</h2>
<p>
    Application firewalls also called an application proxy gateway, are the most recent major evolution in firewall design. Application firewalls serve as a
    proxy between the host and the sender, acting as a server to the host and as a client of the sender. The application firewall then examines the entire
    contents of the package with an understanding of communication protocols that basic stateful filters do not, giving them increased flexibility.[6]
</p>
<p>
    The advantages of an application firewall are an increased level of security because the client and server never directly connect and all traffic,
    including the package payload, is thoroughly inspected for policy violations. Also, application firewall can also incorporate other features, such as
    user-level authentication, connection logging, and data encryption.
</p>
<p>
    The disadvantages of an application firewall are more time spent analyzing packets, decreasing throughput and disrupting real-time applications. Also,
    whenever a new application or protocol is introduced, it needs to be defined in the application firewall. These factors can cause significant disruptions
    in the throughput of large networks. [6,8]
