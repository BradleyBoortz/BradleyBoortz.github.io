   <h2>Network Layer Firwalls</h2>
<p>
    The earliest firewalls were basic packet filters that were defined by which level of the protocol stack that they operate at. These firewalls do not track
    the state of a connection, the simply kept a list of trusted and untrusted sources to determine whether a packet would be received or rejected. They also
    can utilize proxies to hide the true recipient of a packet. [8]
</p>
<p>
    These firewalls were limited by the fact that IP addresses could be spoofed, so using it as the sole source of authentication is problematic. Also, writing
    security policies for a packet filter with sender and receiver as the only information proved to be difficult. The packet filters did not track the purpose
    of the packet or if it was part of an establish connection. A malicious user from a trusted source could send malicious information to a host as the
    trusted source and the firewall would not catch it since these filters do not analyze what is being sent or how it is being sent, just where it is coming
    from. [8]
</p>
<p>
    Later versions of this type operated on multiple levels of the protocol stack so that if one layer was cracked, another layer might catch it. These
    firewalls formed the basis of the next major evolution in firewalls. [8]
